# House-Sales-Price-Prediction
This notebook is part of the Kaggle Competition: "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". I have performed EDA, Feature Engineering, and Logistic Regression techniques on the data to predict the sales price of houses. This is an ongoing project and I will be updating it and trying to improve its performance with different regression techniques.
